Picking the right tool for your coding can sometimes be half the work.
There are plenty of good editors and Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) available for free or cash ranging from simple editors (e.g. `notepad`, `nano`, `vi`) to real coding and debugging powerhouses (Eclipse, Visual Studio,  IntelliJ IDEA, PyCharm).
Some of these might be specialised for a particular programming language while others try to cater to a broad audiance.

While you can write code in the most simple editors, there are a lot of quality-of-life improvements provided by more advanced solutions.
Take your time to try some of them out to figure which one suits you best.
Also, as things progress the "best tool for the job" might change - don't force yourself to stick to a tool you picked 20 years ago.

These docs will cover three such tools that are available across the major Operating Systems: Linux, macOS and Windows:

- [Atom](https://atom.io/), covered [here](editors-and-ides/atom)
- [Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org/), covered [here](editors-and-ides/eclipse)
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), covered [here](editors-and-ides/vscode)

All three examples support more than one programming lanuage and provide additional functionality for debugging code.
