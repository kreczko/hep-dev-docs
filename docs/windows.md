The easiest way to get HEP software development started on Windows is with these three tools:

- [Windows Subsystem For Linux 2 (WSL 2)](windows/wsl)
- [Docker](windows/docker)
- [Visual Studio Code](editors-and-ides/vscode)

WLS 2 will provide you with a integrated way to run Linux (Ubuntu 20.04) within Windows.
Docker will allow you to run an isolated environment for any Linux distribution (e.g. CentOS is popular within HEP).
Visual Studio Code is a very versatile IDE, which will help you with using development tools and coding.

Optionally, you might also want to configure [CVMFS on WSL 2](windows/cvmfs) if you want to access HEP software on yoiur machine.
