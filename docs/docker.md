Docker is a useful tool to create specific, isolated enviroments on your machine. As most HEP software is currently written for the CentOS distribution, Docker can provide a matching environment independent of the Operating System (OS) you currently use.

Docker can be installed on

- Linux ([instructions](linux/docker))
- macOS ([instructions](macos/docker))
- Windows 10 ([instructions](windows/docker)) - provided you have Windows Sybsystem for Linux 2 enabled (([instructions](windows/wls)))
